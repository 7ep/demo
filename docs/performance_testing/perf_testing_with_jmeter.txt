Demonstrating Performance testing with JMeter
---------------------------------------------

Installing Jmeter
-----------------
First and foremost, have Jmeter installed: https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
Then, install plugin manager: https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/
  Installing plugin manager is described on the plugin's page:
  Download the Plugins Manager JAR file and put it into JMeter's lib/ext directory.
  Then start JMeter and go to "Options" menu to access the Plugins Manager.

Open up JMeter.

Open docs/demo.jmx

Open Java Mission Control (jmc) and connect to uitestbox:9999

Open putty to uitestbox and tail -f the logs/catalina.out in Tomcat

Run the test.
You should see quite a lot of action in the Tomcat logs.  While the test is running, take a look at the graphs.

One interesting thing to note is that at a certain point, close to about 80 users, the CPU starts to
max out.  At that point the response time starts going through the roof.



Alternative:
-----------

Window 1:
Prepare command line: java -jar PATH/TO/ApacheJMeter.jar -n --testfile demo.jmx

Window 2:
Open Oracle Java Mission Control (JMC)

Window 3:
Open the log file for Tomcat

Window 4:
Prepare to open the jmeter.log log file to tail it.



In JMC, show the views that show memory and cpu.  Make that clear on
the screen.

Make the logging clearly visible - move the window around to suit.

Show the Jmeter listener graph of thoroughput.
