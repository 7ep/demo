Zap proxy for UI tests
----------------------

It's an excellent idea to have a security scanning proxy to run your UI and API tests through.  What will
happen is that the scanner will inspect everything about each request and response, and will then
be able to notify you of any issues it sees during the run.

(This assumed you have configured Zap to listen on port 9888)

In environment.py, add this import:

from selenium.webdriver.common.proxy import Proxy, ProxyType

and replace __open_browser with this:

def __open_browser(context):
    PROXY = "localhost:9888"

    proxy = Proxy()
    proxy.proxy_type = ProxyType.MANUAL
    proxy.http_proxy = PROXY
    proxy.socks_proxy = PROXY
    proxy.ssl_proxy = PROXY

    capabilities = webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.CHROME
    proxy.add_to_capabilities(capabilities)

    context.driver = webdriver.Chrome(desired_capabilities=capabilities)

Now, run Zap.

Finally, run the tests.  It will run them through that proxy and you will get a report of what it sees.
