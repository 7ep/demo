Demonstrating Performance testing with JMeter

Window 1:
Prepare command line: java -jar PATH/TO/ApacheJMeter.jar -n --testfile demo.jmx

Window 2:
Open Oracle Java Mission Control (JMC)

Window 3:
Open the log file for Tomcat

Window 4:
Prepare to open the jmeter.log log file to tail it.

Set the Tomcat logs to INFO:
in JMC, open the MBean browser and under org.apache.logging.log4j2,
open up the objects and in Loggers, there is a subelement which has a
Level of ERROR.  Set that to INFO.

In JMC, show the views that show memory and cpu.  Make that clear on
the screen.

Make the logging clearly visible - move the window around to suit.

Show the Jmeter listener graph of thoroughput. (How?)
