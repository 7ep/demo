Demonstrating Performance testing with JMeter
---------------------------------------------

Install plugins.  First, install plugin manager: https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/
Then, using plugin manager, install two plugins:
1) jpgc-casutg - see https://jmeter-plugins.org/?search=jpgc-casutg
2) jpgc-graphs-basic - see https://jmeter-plugins.org/?search=jpgc-graphs-basic

Open up JMeter.  We'll do this in the GUI.

Open docs/demo.jmx

Open Java Mission Control (jmc) and connect to uitestbox:9999
Set the Tomcat logs to INFO:
in JMC, open the MBean browser and under org.apache.logging.log4j2,
open up the objects and in Loggers, there is a subelement which has a
Level of ERROR.  Set that to INFO.

Open putty to uitestbox and tail -f the logs/catalina.out in Tomcat

Clear the listeners for the ultimate Thread Group and make sure the other thread group is toggled off.

Run the test.
You should see quite a lot of action in the Tomcat logs.  While the test is running, take a look at the graphs.

One interesting thing to note is that at a certain point, close to about 80 users, the CPU starts to max out.  At that point the response time starts going through the roof.  We've just realized our max load.



Alternative:
-----------

Window 1:
Prepare command line: java -jar PATH/TO/ApacheJMeter.jar -n --testfile demo.jmx

Window 2:
Open Oracle Java Mission Control (JMC)

Window 3:
Open the log file for Tomcat

Window 4:
Prepare to open the jmeter.log log file to tail it.



In JMC, show the views that show memory and cpu.  Make that clear on
the screen.

Make the logging clearly visible - move the window around to suit.

Show the Jmeter listener graph of thoroughput. (How?)
