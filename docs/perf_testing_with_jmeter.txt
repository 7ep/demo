Demonstrating Performance testing with JMeter

Open Jmeter.
Open demo.jmx
Open Oracle Java Mission Control (JMC)
Open the log file for Tomcat
in JMC, open the MBean browser and under org.apache.logging.log4j2, open up the objects and in Loggers, there is a subelement which has a Level of ERROR.  Set that to INFO.
Do some stuff in the web app like trying to register a new user - make sure logging is set to INFO.
In JMC, switch back to the views that show memory and cpu.  Make that big screen.
Make the logging clearly visible - move the window around to suit.
Back in Jmeter, click the Run button (the arrow to the right, like from a cassette player)
You will see that in the logs and in the CPU/Memory, something is happening.

Now, in Thread Group, adjust the number of threads to 1 and run without pauses.  
After, show the graph and the summary report.

Change the number of threads to 5 and run without pauses.

Change the Loop count to forever.

Show the graph of thoroughput.
