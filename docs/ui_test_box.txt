Install Chrome:

 $ sudo yum install -y wget
 $ wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm
 $ sudo yum localinstall -y google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm

Start Chrome by selecting it from the bottom left-hand button and entering
the text "Chrome", then click on the icon.  Choose a means of securing information,
and get through until you see the chrome://welcome page.  Test it by going to Google.com

The system will need a Database.  Install.  See DATABASE_INSTALL in system_guide.txt

We also want to make this database able to be hit from outside the
box, so we can restore and run database migrations on it
from outside.  To do that, first, open the configuration file:

$ sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql/10/data/postgresql.conf

then, replace line

listen_addresses = 'localhost'
    with
listen_addresses = '*'

Get Java installed.  See INSTALL JAVA in system_guide.txt

Install Python Pip, Selenium, and Behave:

$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install behave
$ sudo pip install selenium
$ sudo pip install pyhamcrest

Download Chromedriver from here: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Download and unzip it on your path.  I recommend a place that is
already on your path, /usr/local/sbin
