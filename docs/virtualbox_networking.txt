Networking on the virtual machines and the host.
------------------------------------------------
Switched networking on the boxes. Now, they use NAT (for regular internet) as interface 1,
and Host-Only as 2 (so we can have a conversation between the host and guests)

On the Host box, I configured the Host-only network.  I specifically went into the ipv4 settings and configured them as follows:

IP address: 192.168.56.2
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: 192.168.56.1

Use the following DNS server addresses:
Preferred DNS server: 192.168.56.1

Then, on the guest machines, I used their network configuration tools.  On the console in the jenkinsbox, I used nmtui:

Edit a conntection.
(It may have been necessary to create one.  If so, here are the details.  The only thing to note is that you should change the value of the "Addresses" field - make jenkinsbox 192.168.56.101 and make uitestbox 192.168.56.102:

Profile name: host-only network
Device: 08:00:27:22:04:D9 (enp0s8)

Ethernet
IPv4 configuration <Manual>
Addresses: 192.168.56.101/24
Gateway: 192.168.56.1
DNS Server: 192.168.56.1

At the bottom, select [X] Automatically connect

Then click ok.

It should be possible to use the procedure on both machines.

At this point your networking should be mostly set up.  You can test by pinging between them all.

for example, on the uitestbox:  ping 192.168.56.101 (to ping jenkinsbox)

Now, let's make things prettier.

On jenkinsbox, edit its /etc/hosts and add a new entry to point to uitestbox:

192.168.56.102 uitestbox

On uitestbox, edit its /etc/hosts and add a new entry to point to jenkinsbox:

192.168.56.101 jenkinsbox

On the host, edit hosts and add:

192.168.56.101 jenkinsbox
192.168.56.102 uitestbox
