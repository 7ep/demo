# This is a file meant to be run just before we push our work to
# a remote repository.  It runs the basic set of tests, just to make
# sure that things are generally valid before sending.

# To install this, put it into the git directory under hooks

# this program is expected to be run just before pushing the application to
# a remote repository.  Since that action is rare compared to commits, and because
# we want to be doubly sure of our work before sending it out, we will run
# the gradlew check command.  If that fails, we want to correct things first.

# stash all changes, including what is in the index (the staging area between
# the working directory and the repository).  This is so that when we run our
# tests, we are only testing the stuff that's fully committed to the repo
# and that is going to be sent to the central repo, since this is pre-push

git stash push -q

# run the tests with the gradle wrapper
./gradlew check

# store the last exit code in a variable
RESULT=$?

# unstash the stashed changes
git stash pop -q

# return the './gradlew check' exit code
exit $RESULT
