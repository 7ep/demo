 create a console-only virtual machine for our work.

1. created new box on VirtualBox version 5.2.12 r122591 (Qt5.6.2)

2. gave it 1024 megabytes of ram and 4 gigabytes of hard drive storage

3. in File -> Preferences, click on Network, and click the icon on the
right to create a new network.  Double click on the newly created
network and rename it training_network, and click OK.)

in settings:
  Put the Centos7 dvd in its virtual drive...
  
  in the network tab, make it attached to: NAT network, and then
    I selected a name: training_network (a network we previously created)

Start it up.

Choose "install Centos 7".  (It defaults to "test this media and
install centos7", but it's a virtual machine, so just press the up
arrow and choose "install centos 7".)

Choose English for the languages.

Under system, click on "installation destination" and then click Done
on the page it opens up.  (it defaults properly)

Click on the network & Host name icon and toggle it from off to on,
then click Done.

Click on the "Begin Installation" button in the bottom right.

While it is installing, you will see options to set the root password
and create a user.  We're not too concerned about security, since this
box is just for educational purposes.  However, it won't let you
complete installation until you create a user.  Make a user for
yourself.  I recommend enabling it as an administrator user (check the
box) and make it not require a password (uncheck that box).

Finally, it finishes, and you can click the button labeled "reboot".  Do so.

Once it finishes rebooting, you will see a console window waiting for
you to enter your username.  It should look like this:

---------------------------------------------------

CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
Kernel 3.10.0-693.el7.x86_64 on an x86_64

localhost login: _

---------------------------------------------------

I find that working in that console is a pain.  So the first thing we
want to do is make sure we can access this using ssh and then we'll
communicate with our machine solely through that protocol.



First, log in as the user you created.  You didn't set a password, so
you shouldn't need to enter a password for it.  It's an admin user, so
you can just run sudo <whatever> to act as root.

First, let's turn off the firewall and SELinux (its security system).
It's a pain in the rear, and remember, this is for educational
purposes, so security is *not* a concern.  Ease of use is.  

$ #turn off the firewall and disable it
$ sudo systemctl stop firewalld
$ sudo systemctl disable firewalld

To disable SELinux, open /etc/selinux/config and set SELINUX mode to
disabled.  You can do that with an editor, or you can run this
command:

sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config

Let's also change the settings on sshd (the ssh daemon) so it will
allow us to log in without a password.  Edit the file at
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and change the value of a parameter:

#PermitEmptyPasswords no

becomes

PermitEmptyPasswords yes

or you can run this command:

sudo sed -i 's/#PermitEmptyPasswords no/PermitEmptyPasswords yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

now, reboot.

$ sudo reboot


run this:

  $ ip addr
  
It should show you the network details.  You are looking for the ip
address this box was assigned by the network.  It should resemble this
value: 10.0.2.15/24

(One interesting note: I found that when going through these steps,
that VirtualBox had reset my network settings for this box to basic
NAT, rather than Nat Network like I previously had set.  If that
happens to you, just go back into the box's settings and reset it to
NAT Network.  This will also probably change the ip address of the
box, so you may need to run ip addr again to see what it is now.)

Once you have that, click on the menu item File -> Preferences ->
Network and double-click on training_network, and click on the "Port
Forwarding" button.  Add a new row, as follows (modify for your ip
address)

+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| Name  | Protocol | Host IP | Host Port | Guest IP  | Guest Port |
+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| ssh   | TCP      |         | 2222      | 10.0.2.15 | 22         |
+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Then click all the OK buttons to close the windows.

You should be able to ssh into your centos box by running ssh against
localhost at 2222.


From here on out, all commands should be run from ssh.

Let's install Java:

$ sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

git:

$ sudo yum -y install git

Let's pull down our demo project now.

$ git clone https://github.com/7ep/demo.git

$ cd demo

$ ./gradlew appRun

It will take a while to pull down some packages from the internet, but
when it's done you should see something like this:

  Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)
  15:00:09 INFO  Jetty 9.2.24.v20180105 started and listening on port 8888
  15:00:09 INFO  demo runs at:
  15:00:09 INFO    http://localhost:8888/demo

  > Task :appRun
  Press any key to stop the server.
  <===========--> 88% EXECUTING [2m 26s]
  > :appRun
  > IDLE

In order to access the application from our host, we will want to open
up a port forwarding between our system and the guest.  Go to
virtualbox and to the menu bar, and go to File -> preferences ->
Network.  Double-click on "training_network" and click on Port
forwarding, and add this new rule (adjust the ip address per your
machine):

+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| Name  | Protocol | Host IP | Host Port | Guest IP  | Guest Port |
+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| ssh   | TCP      |         | 8888      | 10.0.2.15 | 8888       |
+-------+----------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Once you click OK to close all the windows, you should be able to open
up a url to the application from the host machine:

http://localhost:8888/demo/

Voila!

Let's add a few more features.  

Let's add vim, which is a handier editor.

$ sudo yum -y install vim

Let's install a browser that can run in the console.

$ sudo yum -y install lynx

Let's add a database, since we'll plan to use a real database for the
next sprint instead of a text file.

$ sudo yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm
$ sudo yum install postgresql10
$ sudo yum install postgresql10-server

$ sudo /usr/pgsql-10/bin/postgresql-10-setup initdb
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql-10

There is a command to start up the database on boot.  We won't use
that for now - we want everything to be intentional.  If we need a
database, we'll need to start it ourselves.  For reference, the
command to have it start on boot is sudo systemctl enable
postgresql-10.

Recall that this is all educational, so security isn't the slightest
concern.  So what we will do here is make the database easily
accessible so we can work with it.  Dealing with security is a pain,
by definition, so we'll skip that in this exercise.

First, we'll switch to being the user "postgres":

$ sudo su - postgres

Then, we'll open the postgresql client:

$ psql

We should see something like this:

  -bash-4.2$ psql
  psql (9.2.24, server 10.6)
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=#
  
Alright, we know the database is up and we can access it.  Let's make
it easier to access.  Still in the psql client, run this command:

  postgres=# CREATE ROLE brk WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN;
  CREATE ROLE
  
View your new role by typing \dg

Log out of psql by running typing \q and pressing enter.

exit out of being postgres and be your original user again.  Try to
access the psql client from there:

$ psql postgres

You should see something like this:

  [brk@localhost demo]$ psql postgres
  psql (9.2.24)
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=#

One last thing.  We'll modify the Postgresql configuration file so it
trusts everyone implicitly, making it less secure but easier to work
with.  Yet again, something you wouldn't want to do on a production
system!  But we're not working with a production system, we want
things to be easy.

In the directory where the data files are kept is a file called
pg_hba.conf.  On my Centos7 Linux box I find it in
/var/lib/pgsql/10/data.  On my Windows box it is at C:\Program
Files\PostgreSQL\10\data.

Modify this file.  Towards the end of the file you will see some lines
like this:

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident

Change the values in the column METHOD to "trust" instead of "md5" or
"ident".  That will make the database trust whoever accesses it
locally, implicitly and completely.  This means you don't need to
provide passwords when running commands anymore, though you still need
to have roles within the database.

In order to create backups of the database, run this command:

 (make sure to come up with an apt DESCRIPTION and a VERSION for this
 command)

pg_dump -Fc training > <DESCRIPTION>_<VERSION>.dump

The restore command is exemplified in our tests.  See
setDatabaseState in PersistenceLayerTests.
