feature: able to use AWS to CI/CD "Demo"

user story:
   As a Coveros trainer
   I want to be able to demonstrate the CI/CD process for Demo on AWS
   So that I can show something that resembles a realistic cloud CI/CD

Scenario: Happy path 
  When I start the CI/CD process
  Then it carries all the way through

Scenario: Doing this without minimal authentication
  Given the CI/CD system is all up and running
  When I log into Jenkins with minimal security
  I can kick off a successful CI/CD

Scenario: booting the system
  Given I have secure access to AWS
  When I carry out a few simple and easy commands
  Then the system becomes booted up for later usage
