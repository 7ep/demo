For the Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture:

    Demo needs to be running somewhere, so we need a test server - spooled up as needed
    Jenkins (for CI/CD) needs a box - stays up
    Jenkins also requires a Windows box for running UI tests - stays up
    Sonarqube (for static analysis) needs a box - stays up
